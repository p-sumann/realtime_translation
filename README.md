# Translation Service API

This is not a core AI/ML project rather learning FastAPI to deploy and run ml models on production.

This application leverages OpenAI/Gemini to provide real-time translation of documents. It uses FastAPI for the backend to handle API requests and Streamlit for the frontend to create an interactive user interface. The combination of these technologies ensures a seamless and efficient translation experience.
